# COBOL Data Redefinition Bug

This repository demonstrates a subtle bug related to data redefinition in COBOL.  The program moves a numeric value to a sub-field within a redefined area but displays unexpected results due to how COBOL handles redefinitions. 

The `bug.cob` file contains the erroneous code. The `solution.cob` file shows a corrected version, highlighting best practices to avoid such errors. 

## Bug Description:
The bug arises from not fully understanding how redefinition interacts with data manipulation. When a value is moved to a sub-field of a redefined structure, the entire redefined area might be affected in ways not immediately obvious.

## Solution:
The solution focuses on ensuring that data manipulation strictly adheres to the intended structure to avoid unintended side effects from redefinition.
